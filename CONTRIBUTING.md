## Opening Issues

## Coding Style

- use unix line endings (not windows)
- indent your code with TABs instead of spaces
- use utf8 file encoding (ANSI encoding is strictly forbidden!)
- use speaking names for variables.
- avoid code dups -> if you write similar code blocks more the 2 times -> refactoring!

* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

### Our Responsibilities
